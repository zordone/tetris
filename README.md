# Tetris

A tetris clone I made years ago (~2013).

For the most fun, be sure to turn on the music on the settings page. (Music: Sabrepulse - The Fourth Sequence.)

The scoring has lots of bonuses for speed, sprees, multiple rows, etc.


### Tech

ES5, RequireJS, jQuery, Canvas, plain CSS.


### Usage

Just open `tetris.html` from the filesystem. Preferably in Chrome.

Or you can just try it out [here](https://zordone.github.io/tetris/tetris.html) without downloading.
